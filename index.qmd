## Description

This 2-credit course is designed to refresh topics foundational
to Computational Expression (CMPSC 100) and to reinforce
beneficial practices related to computer use for majors and
non-majors. Topics include computer skills, tech literacy, pattern
identification, and algebra-based logic for computational problems.
Hands-on learning activities will contribute to team-building and
practice widely-applicable strategies for reasoning. Students will
receive individualized support, maximizing opportunities for success
in computer and information science and related fields.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Navigate computer with graphical and text-based tools
2. Solve computational problems with hierarchical and sequential structures
3. Identify and evaluate resources for troubleshooting computational problems
4. Describe and use mathematical operators and algebra-based logic in computational problems

### Other Outcomes

Successfully completing this course will give you:

- guaranteed slot in CMPSC 100 next semester
- one extra homework token for CMPSC 100
