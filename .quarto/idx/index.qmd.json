Topics include computer skills, tech literacy, pattern\nidentification, and algebra-based logic for computational problems.\nHands-on learning activities will contribute to team-building and\npractice widely-applicable strategies for reasoning. Students will\nreceive individualized support, maximizing opportunities for success\nin computer and information science and related fields.\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\n1. Navigate computer with graphical and text-based tools\n2. Solve computational problems with hierarchical and sequential structures\n3. Identify and evaluate resources for troubleshooting computational problems\n4. Describe and use mathematical operators and algebra-based logic in computational problems\n\n### Other Outcomes\n\nSuccessfully completing this course will give you:\n\n- guaranteed slot in CMPSC 100 next semester\n- one extra homework token for CMPSC 100\n\n## Schedule Outline\n\n- Week 1 - Jan 13 - [Approaching Problems](materials.qmd#week-one-approaching-problems)\n- Week 2 - Jan 17 - [File Systems](materials.qmd#week-two-file-systems)\n- Week 3 - Feb 3 - [Computer Skills](materials.qmd#week-three-computer-skills)\n- Week 4 - Feb 10 - [Mathematical Operations](materials.qmd#week-four-mathematical-operations)\n- Week 5 - Feb 17 - [Abstraction and Estimation](materials.qmd#week-five-abstraction-and-estimation)\n- Week 6 - Feb 24 - [Review](materials.qmd#week-six-review)\n\n## Activities\n\n- PB&J sandwiches (LO 2)\n- Files (LO 1)\n- Scavenger Hunt (LO 2)\n- Typing + Searching (LO 1, L0 3)\n- Jeopardy (LO 4)\n- Estimation (LO 2, LO 4)\n  \n<!-- - Activity 1 - [Estimation (LO 2, LO 4)](/Week1-ApproachingProblems/activity-estimation/)\n- Activity 2 - [Files (LO 1)](/Week2-FileSystems/activity-files/)\n- Activity 3 - [Typing + Searching (LO 1, L0 3)](/Week3-ComputerSkills/activity-type+search/)\n- Activity 4 - Blue & Gold Panel Talk\n- PB&J sandwiches + Scavenger Hunt (LO 2)](/Week5-LogicalReasoning/activity-scavengerhunt/)\n- Activity 6 - [Jeopardy (LO 4)](/Week6-MathematicalOperations/activity-jeopardy/) -->\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/877320365825749002/1326701591969140799) -\n  `https://discord.com/channels/877320365825749002/1326701591969140799`\n- [Website](https://allegheny-college-ls-591-spring-2025.github.io/site/) -\n  `https://allegheny-college-ls-591-spring-2025.github.io/site/`\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/allegheny-college-ls-591-spring-2025) -\n  `https://github.com/allegheny-college-ls-591-fall-2024`\n- [Videos](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r61X-lCqCnmjonBCHdZ6AfC2DatKs5B9ADU7LGoPrUQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Grading\n\nCredit/No Credit.
