## Course Overview

::: incremental
- This course is a review of computational skills and problem solving strategies that are foundational to Computational Expression (CMPSC 100)
- Hands-on learning activities will contribute to team-building and practice widely-applicable strategies for reasoning.
- 2 credits, pass/fail
- It is imperative to attend class because activities take place in class, collaboratively
- If you know you cannot attend all the classes, please message Prof. Graber and Green!

- a student knows they are going to be late to a one-on-one office hours appointment?
- a student wants to submit their work late but not use a token?
- a student has a question but has not reviewed notes or read the textbook?

## Activities

::: incremental
Each week, we have a group activity planned:

- Making PB&J sandwiches
- Locating Mario & scavenger hunt
- Typing + Wikipedia races
- Computational jeopardy
- Estimation 
:::

## PB&J Activity

::: incremental
- Split into two groups 
- Write instructions for your professors to make a PB&J sandwich [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m7O--TNvEK-KEJefZ7IMXnZ2FGdbTyl9ZqxN2UYQn_0/edit?usp=sharing)!
- Your professor should be able to follow the directions to make a PB&J even if they've never seen a sandwich before!
