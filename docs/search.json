It looks like this emoji is missing an eye! But if you scroll down you’ll see variables for both left_eye and right_eye? You can actually fix by changing the math operation on the x position for one of the eyes. Can you figure out how to do it?\nThe emoji’s face looks more like an alien! Can you change the value of one of the first two variables to make the skin more like a classic emoji?\nCan you change another variable’s value to make the color of the eyes and mouth look more like a classic emoji?\nOnce you’ve made all these changes, one eye color is still out of place! Can you fix this by applying one of the first two varables to the rogue eye’s color property?"
