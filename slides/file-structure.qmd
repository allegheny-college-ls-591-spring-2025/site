# File Systems

## File Systems are Hierarchical

**Folders** (also known as **paths** or **directories**) can hold both files and other folders. A tree metaphor is often used to describe file systems, but a box that holds both objects (files) and other boxes (folders) is another way to think about it.

These are two representations of the same file system. 

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
![](/images/file-structure.png){width="70%"}
:::
::: {.column}
```
└── red
    ├── yellow
    │   ├── green
    │   └── purple
    └── orange
```

## Parents, Children, Siblings

Parents, children, and siblings describe relations between files and folders. In this folder tree, `red` is a parent of `yellow` and `orange`. `Green` and `purple` are children of `yellow`. `Yellow` and `orange` are siblings. 

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
![](/images/file-structure.png){width="70%"}
:::
::: {.column}
```
└── red
    ├── yellow
    │   ├── green
    │   └── purple
    └── orange
```

## Directories

Directory is another word for folder!

## Root Directory

The **root** directory is the folder that contains all other directories and files! In this case, `red` contains all the others and could be considered the root.

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
![](/images/file-structure.png){width="70%"}
:::
::: {.column}
```
└── red
    ├── yellow
    │   ├── green
    │   └── purple
    └── orange
```   
:::
::::::


## Path

The full **path** to a certain file should start at the root direct and get more and more specific. For example, the path to purple is `red/yellow/purple`.

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
![](/images/file-structure.png){width="70%"}
:::
::: {.column}
```
└── red
    ├── yellow
    │   ├── green
    │   └── purple
    └── orange
```

## Where are my files?

The file explorer or the terminal can be used to navigate through the file system. Today we will use the file explorer.

## File Structure Activity

Use the Activity Sheet linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aIPf2ZkHeOAF-N-qLz71iIwLwx0sdi66zhXGC8bZAQ8/edit?usp=sharing)

::: incremental
- Part 1
  - Split into two groups 
  - Write down the file structure made by the boxes and Mario characters!
  - Disassemble everything.
- Part 2
  - After the structure is written down, exchange structures and recreate the structure of the other group.

## Questions

::: incremental
- What were the **files**?
- What were the **directories**?
- What was the **root**?
- Does a file path start out narrow or broad?
